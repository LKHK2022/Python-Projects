Such fluctuations change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.\n","\n","GDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's standard of living; however, this is inaccurate because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income.\n","\n","Comparisons of national income are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. (See List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita.) PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.</p>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"439369dd","metadata":{"id":"439369dd"},"source":["Here are some resources to learn about GDP:\n","#### [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd?most_recent_value_desc=false)\n","#### [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank)\n","#### [IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD)\n","#### [UN Data](https://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=SNAAMA&f=grID%3A101%3BcurrID%3AUSD%3BpcFlag%3A1)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"id":"c877d1ec","metadata":{"id":"c877d1ec","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740169940529,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":48,"user":{"displayName":"Layal Haroon","userId":"13086455801902639086"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["df=pd.DataFrame()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"id":"803cc22b","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":73},"id":"803cc22b","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740169968092,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":14789,"user":{"displayName":"Layal Haroon","userId":"13086455801902639086"}},"outputId":"5dfc77eb-85ce-4971-8b5a-c66d5ffd385d"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","     <input type=\"file\" id=\"files-8ec0d4d8-9919-418b-9f95-765b3504e2d6\" name=\"files[]\" multiple disabled\n","        style=\"border:none\" />\n","     <output id=\"result-8ec0d4d8-9919-418b-9f95-765b3504e2d6\">\n","      Upload widget is only available when the cell has been executed in the\n","      current browser session.
