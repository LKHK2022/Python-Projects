Python and Pandas Practice 🐍📊

Overview

This repository contains my workbooks covering Python Beginner (Part 1 & 2) and Pandas Practice (Part 1 & 2). These workbooks showcase my journey from the basics of Python to more advanced data manipulation with Pandas.

Projects Breakdown

Python Beginner - Part 1 & 2 🐍

Skills Covered:

Variables & Data Types 💡: Understanding and using integers, floats, strings, booleans, and more.

Control Flow 🔀: Mastered if, else, and elif statements to make decisions in the code.

Loops 🔄: Implemented for and while loops for iterating over data.

Functions 🔧: Defined and called functions to reuse code effectively.

Lists & Tuples 📋: Created and manipulated lists and tuples for ordered collections of data.

Dictionaries 📚: Stored key-value pairs to manage data efficiently.

Basic Error Handling ⚠️: Used try, except blocks to catch and handle errors in the code.

Pandas Practice - Part 1 & 2 📊

Skills Covered:

Data Structures 🗂️: Understanding and using Pandas Series and DataFrames.

Data Loading 🚚: Importing data from CSV, Excel, and other file formats using pd.read_csv() and pd.read_excel().

Data Inspection 🔍: Analyzing the first and last few rows using head(), tail(), and getting an overview with info().

Data Cleaning 🧹: Handling missing data, renaming columns, and converting data types.

Data Selection 📑: Selecting rows, columns, and subsets using .loc[], .iloc[], and boolean indexing.

Sorting & Filtering 🧭: Sorting data and filtering based on conditions (using sort_values(), query(), and conditions).

Aggregations & Grouping 📊: Using groupby() to aggregate data and summarize large datasets.

Merging & Joining Data 🔗: Combining multiple DataFrames using merge() and concat() to join related data.

Pivoting & Reshaping 🔄: Creating pivot tables and reshaping data with pivot_table() and melt().

Visualizations 📈: Basic data visualization using Pandas' built-in plotting functions (e.g., plot()).
